# Who uses PSICQUIC? #

This is the list of some of the projects that use PSICQUIC to query molecular interaction data. There are more, but these are the ones known to us as of July 2011. If you are using PSICQUIC, please let us know and we will add you to this list.

  * **Bio::Homology::InterologWalk**: a Perl module to build putative protein-protein interaction networks through interolog mapping. [[Publication](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/289/abstract)]

  * **Cytoscape**: can create interation networks using a [PSICQUIC plugin](CytoscapeClient.md).

  * **EnVision 2**: a visualization application for the [Enfin project](http://www.enfin.org).

  * **IMEx Consortium**: the data search in the consortium page is based on PSICQUIC to query all the IMEx members on-the-fly. [[Link](http://www.imexconsortium.org/)] [[Publication](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.200700286/abstract)]

  * **IntAct**: the user is presented with counts and links to other PSICQUIC services when executing a query. [[Link](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact)] [[Publication](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/suppl_1/D525.full)]

  * **Reactome**: it exploits the PSICQUIC web services to overlay molecular interaction data in the Pathway Browser [[Link](http://www.reactome.org)] [[Publication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686536/)]

  * **Taverna**: PSICQUIC workflows in Taverna. [[Link](http://www.myexperiment.org/groups/570.html#shared_items)]
