# PERL examples

All the PERL examples in this page use the REST access as it is straight-forward to use for scripting languages.

## Accessing the registry

* [List all the Services and its base URL](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-registry-client/blob/master/src/example/perl/read-registry.pl).

## Querying PSICQUIC services

The following examples can be used to access PSICQUIC services.

* [Query one service](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-solr-ws/blob/master/src/example/perl/read-single-psicquic.pl).
* [Query all the services](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-solr-ws/blob/master/src/example/perl/read-all-psicquic.pl): It queries the registry to get all the services and then executes a query for one of them.
