## PSICQUIC reference implementation based on LUCENE ##

This is the original psicquic reference implementation which is able to index a MITAB 2.5 file and which is based on LUCENE. This implementation will not be further developed and the PSICQUIC reference implementation based on [SOLR](HowToInstallPsicquicSolr.md) should be used instead. You can find more information about how to install PSICQUIC using LUCENE [here](HowToInstall.md).
