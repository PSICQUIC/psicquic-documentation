# Python examples #

All the Python examples in this page use the REST access as it is straight-forward to use for scripting languages.

## Accessing the registry ##

  * [List all the Services and its base URL](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-registry/blob/master/src/example/python/read-registry.py).
  * [List all the Services showing more details about the service](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-registry/blob/master/src/example/python/read-registry-more-info.py).

## Querying PSICQUIC services ##

The following examples can be used to access PSICQUIC services.

  * [Query one service](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-webservice/blob/master/src/example/python/read-single-psicquic.py).
  * [Query all the services](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-webservice/blob/master/src/example/python/read-all-psicquic.py): It queries the registry to get all the services and then executes a query for one of them.
